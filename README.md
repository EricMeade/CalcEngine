# CalcEngine
Expression Evaluator
This is a branch of CalcEngine first release on CodeProject: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipies/CalcEngine.aspx. 

It has been updated with a dependency manager, ability to create dynamic functions which execute using a sub context. Which gives you the ability to write multiple expressions and functions to be applied to the data context. Also, core functionality has been aaded to evaluate enumerations, null values, switch statements, 'this' and 'root' variables to access the current and root context.

These additions allow the user to create a set of calculations, with flow control, in c# like format to manipulate the data context.
